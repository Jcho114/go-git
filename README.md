# Practice Project Git In Go

This is a side project for my own learning. I plan to add most core features, mostly
following online guidelines and whatnot, so yeah, we will see how far I can get here.

## Resources

These are the resources I primarily used to create my implementation. At some points it
kind of felt like I was porting code but at least I learned about implementation
details of git!
