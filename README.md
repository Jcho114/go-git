# Practice Project Git In Go

This is a side project for my own learning. I am basically using [wyag](https://wyag.thb.lt/)
as a pretty big reference, so it is mostly porting code as I learn more about the implementation
details of git. Maybe I will redo the project without such a "crutch" another time, but as
mentioned above, this project is to learn about git.
